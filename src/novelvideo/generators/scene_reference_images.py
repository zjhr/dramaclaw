SCENE CONTEXT:

PURPOSE:
- This is a director/debug reference map for optional spatial reasoning and hidden
  experimental voxel tools. It is NOT a required input for the default master/reverse
  scene workflow, and 360 panorama generation must not depend on it.
- It must clarify fixed scene geography for the ENTIRE 360 degrees around the camera,
  not just what the master image shows.
- It must clarify fixed scene geography only: walls, doors, windows, entrances, counters,
  work surfaces, furniture groups, seat/standing blocks, aisles, fixed fixtures, and reusable
  prop/action zones.
- For each wall (front / back / left / right), explicitly draw the openings, doors, windows,
  and adjacent fixtures stated in the SCENE CONTEXT, even if not visible in the master.
- Do not create a generic busy version of the location type. Reconstruct only what is visible
  in the master OR explicitly stated in the SCENE CONTEXT text.
- Do not place story characters, identity markers, actor circles, gaze arrows, or beat-specific
  movement paths in this scene-level map. Character blocking belongs in a later episode/beat
  blocking map derived from this empty scene map.
- Do not use screenplay beat text or genre expectations to invent extra furniture not stated
  in the SCENE CONTEXT.

STYLE:
- Clean top-down orthographic floorplan.
- White background, black room outlines, neutral gray tables/chairs/counter/door.
- Use only rectangles, outlines, straight lines, and simple icons for furniture groups,
  seat/standing blocks, counters, work surfaces, doors, windows, shelves, fixtures, and reusable
  action zones.
- Avoid circular dots, head-like circles, torso-like triangles, stick figures, silhouettes, or
  any symbol that could be mistaken for a person.
- Sparse large labels only when needed for reference readability.

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Infer one top-down map covering all four cardinal directions around the camera; do not render a panorama, collage, or camera view.
- Camera/viewer convention: the camera sits at the center of the floorplan. The wall at the top
  of the floorplan = FRONT wall (the one visible in the master). The wall at the bottom = BACK wall.
  The wall on the left = LEFT wall. The wall on the right = RIGHT wall.
- Place every named opening/fixture from SCENE CONTEXT on its correct wall using that convention.
- Show fixed object positions and aisle/depth relation between zones.
- Mark reusable zones generically when needed, such as "foreground furniture zone",
  "right-back action zone", "aisle", "door", "counter", or the scene-specific zone ids.
- Do not use character names or identity colors.
- Do not draw seat zones as circles; draw chairs/stools as small rectangles or square blocks.

HARD NEGATIVES:
- No realistic people.
- No people.
- No human silhouettes.
- No head-like circles.
- No body-like icons.
- No stick figures.
- No character markers.
- No colored identity circles.
- No actor labels.
- No gaze arrows.
- No beat-specific movement arrows.
- No perspective camera shot.
- No decorative illustration.
- No collage.
- No dense text.
- No subtitles, UI, watermark, or comic panel titles.
- Do not use this as a story beat; it is a reusable scene spatial contract.

{style_block}

{scene_block}

COMPOSITION:
- Eye-level horizon, wide ~160-180° horizontal coverage matching the master coverage model:
  back center plus roughly half of the left side and half of the right side.
- Camera position = same as REFERENCE 1's camera, facing the {back_word} (the side the
  SCENE DESCRIPTION labels as 背面 / back / 后).
- The {back_word} is the dominant feature filling the central area of the frame.
- The front-facing focal subject of REFERENCE 1 is now BEHIND the camera, so it does not
  need to be in this image. Show the back-facing content instead.
- If the SCENE DESCRIPTION text describes specific items on the back side (e.g. "背面是 X"),
  those items should be the focal content of this image.

REVERSE COVERAGE:
- This reverse view covers the back-facing half of the same scene: back center plus
  the remaining visible halves of the left and right sides.
- Together, master + reverse should describe the full 360-degree space:
  master = front + left-half + right-half; reverse = back + left-half + right-half.
- Mild wide-angle edge distortion is acceptable, but do not create a fisheye or panorama unwrap.

REQUIRED EDGE OVERLAP (HARD RULE):
- The LEFT edge of this reverse view MUST connect to the same physical side-wall / side-environment
  family visible on REFERENCE 1's RIGHT edge (they are the same physical {side_word}
  section seen from opposite directions — same materials, same props, same lighting).
- The RIGHT edge of this reverse view MUST connect to the same physical side-wall /
  side-environment family visible on REFERENCE 1's LEFT edge.
- Treat these overlap zones as material / lighting / fixture alignment anchors. Make them
  visually continuous with master so the two views can be mentally stitched into one space.
- This overlap is NOT optional and NOT decorative — it is what makes the two views
  co-registerable for downstream geometry reconstruction.

CENTER REGION — NEW CONTENT:
- The central region of this reverse shows what is BEHIND master's camera (the {back_word}
  and surrounding back-side environment). This content is NOT visible in REFERENCE 1.
- Fill the center from the SCENE DESCRIPTION's 背面 / back-side notes, while keeping
  master's exact style / lighting / material vocabulary.
- Do NOT invent objects absent from both master and the SCENE DESCRIPTION just to "make
  the reverse different". If the back side has nothing notable, show a quiet open
  back-facing view consistent with master's style.

STRICT STYLE LOCK — REFERENCE 1 IS THE ONLY VISUAL ANCHOR:
- Match REFERENCE 1's art style EXACTLY: same linework density, same texture quality,
  same color palette, same finish.
- Match REFERENCE 1's lighting EXACTLY: same warmth/coolness, same brightness, same
  shadow direction, same exposure, same color temperature. If REFERENCE 1 is warm/amber,
  the reverse MUST be warm/amber too — do NOT drift into cool/blue/dark.
- Match REFERENCE 1's surface materials exactly (wall/floor/ground/ceiling/exterior trim).
  The reverse view is the SAME {space_word}, so the same surface treatment MUST appear
  at the meets of {side_word} and ground.
- Do NOT shift the time of day. If REFERENCE 1 looks like day, reverse must look like day.

IGNORE TEXT DESCRIPTORS THAT WOULD BREAK STYLE LOCK:
- IGNORE any mood / time-of-day descriptors in the SCENE DESCRIPTION (深夜 / 昏暗 / 光晕 /
  街灯 / 萧瑟 / 局促 / 暖色荧光 / 营业 etc.). These are story notes, not visual ground truth.
- The only visual ground truth for lighting & style is REFERENCE 1's pixels.

CLOSED-WORLD CONSTRAINT:
- Fixture identity MUST match REFERENCE 1's vocabulary (if master shows wooden furniture,
  reverse stays with wooden furniture; if master shows urban architecture, reverse stays
  with urban architecture; etc.). Do not invent fixture styles that don't appear anywhere
  in master's visual vocabulary or the SCENE DESCRIPTION.
- Use the SCENE DESCRIPTION ONLY to know what objects/fixtures sit on the back side.
  Do NOT use it to override REFERENCE 1's style or lighting.
- No people, no characters, no temporary story props.
- No readable text, subtitles, labels, watermarks, panel titles.

HARD REQUIREMENTS:
- Eye-level wide rectilinear perspective. Mild edge barrel distortion is
  expected. NO extreme fisheye (>180° FOV), NO equirectangular panorama, NO 360 unwrap,
  NO top-down floorplan, NO collage, NO multi-panel sheet.
- 16:9 aspect ratio (same as REFERENCE 1).
- One single finished establishing image.
