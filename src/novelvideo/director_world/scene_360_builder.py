- The output is a 2:1 equirectangular unwrap. Its horizontal x-axis is yaw angle.
- Use a SAFE-SEAM raw canvas layout. The raw image is intentionally yaw-shifted
  so the left/right seam lands on a low-detail side wall instead of on the
  reverse hallway / back-center features.
- The downstream 360 viewer and 360->PLY step will apply sphere yaw correction
  {SAFE_SEAM_SPHERE_YAW_DEG:.0f}° so the corrected default yaw 0° / FRONT still shows
  master.png's center.
- Therefore the RAW panorama canvas placement MUST be:
  - x=0% and x=100% / left-right seam = low-detail LEFT SIDE wall continuation
    where master left side merges with reverse screen-right side.
  - x=25% = master front center.
  - x=50% = RIGHT SIDE transition zone where master right edge merges with
    reverse screen-left edge.
  - x=75% = reverse back center.
- If topology_strip_2to1.jpg is attached, follow that topology map's horizontal order exactly:
  left-side seam/continuation -> master front center -> right-side join ->
  reverse back center -> left-side seam/continuation.
- The reverse back center is ONE physical direction around x=75%, not two
  duplicated directions at the left and right edges.
- BACK-ONLY reverse-center objects listed by the spatial contract must stay
  centered around x=75%. Do not move a back-wall desk, bookshelf, cabinet,
  window, door, or display panel into x=50%; x=50% is only the right-side join.
- FRONT-ONLY master-center objects listed by the spatial contract must stay
  centered around x=25%. Do not move front-wall fixtures into x=50% or x=75%.
- Reverse screen-left content must land in raw panorama x=50%..75%; reverse
  screen-right content must land in raw panorama x=75%..100%. This orientation
  is mandatory and must not be flipped.
- The x=0%/100% seam must be a plain continuous side wall/floor/ceiling zone.
  Do NOT put a hallway, doorway, elevator, display panel, sign, lamp, or
  unlisted unique fixture on the seam. If the spatial contract explicitly lists
  a SHARED OVERLAP anchor at the side join, render it once as a seam-adjacent
  continuous/split physical object, never as two independent copies.
- Do NOT render a complete reverse corridor / doorway / back-wall feature once
  near the left edge and again near the right edge. Keep reverse back-center
  hallway/display/sign features together around x=75%.
- Do NOT duplicate unique reverse-side objects, ads, doors, corridor openings,
  plaques, lamps, or wall panels at both outer sides. The two outer edges are
  adjacent halves of the SAME low-detail side wall.
- UNIQUE FIXTURE SIDE LOCK:
  - Around x=25% / master front center, preserve the screen-space side placement
    visible in master.png. Do not mirror unique front fixtures across the center.
  - Around x=75% / reverse back center, preserve the screen-space side placement
    visible in reverse_master.png. Do not split reverse center across the seam.
  - If a unique cabinet/panel/sign appears on one side of a doorway/elevator in
    the input references, it must remain on that same referenced side in the
    corresponding viewer direction. Do not move it to the opposite side.
  - Do not reinterpret fixture categories: an illuminated display panel / lightbox
    must remain an illuminated display panel / lightbox, a sign must remain a sign,
    a cabinet must remain a cabinet, and a call button panel must remain a call
    button panel. Never turn these unique fixtures into doorways or corridors.
  - Preserve relative fixture scale from the input view. A large wall display
    or lightbox must remain a large wall display/lightbox, not shrink into a
    small poster or side plaque. Do not add extra unreferenced panels to compensate.
- Do NOT put master center and reverse center next to each other inside the middle
  of the panorama. They are opposite directions, exactly 180° apart.
- Do NOT make a triangular/fan-shaped room where front and back are only 90° apart.

PROJECTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Correct equirectangular spherical panorama projection.
- Output must be one continuous 2:1 panorama, suitable for a VR/360 panorama viewer.
- Camera is fixed at the center of the room at normal human eye height.
- Full 360-degree environment around the camera.
- Left and right edges must connect seamlessly with no visible seam.
- When master+reverse references are attached, the left/right seam is a safe
  low-detail side wall continuation. It must not cut or duplicate a reverse
  hallway, doorway, display panel, sign, cabinet, or other unique fixture.
  Explicit SHARED OVERLAP anchors may be seam-adjacent only if they merge into
  one physical object in a 360 viewer, not one copy on each panorama edge.
- When master+reverse references are NOT attached, the first and last columns must
  depict the same continuous surface/material and should avoid cutting a unique object.
- Horizon must be level and centered.
- Use normal VR panorama projection: no single flat wide shot, no 4-panel sheet,
  no cubemap atlas, no borders.
- In a 360 viewer, walls, doors, windows, counters, furniture/fixture groups,
  ceiling elements, and floor materials should look coherent and continuous.
- Geometry must remain stable after spherical wrapping: straight walls should
  stay straight, door/window rectangles should not melt, stretch, or duplicate.
- Avoid large close foreground objects crossing the left/right seam.
- Keep important objects away from extreme top/bottom polar distortion when possible.
- Ceiling and floor poles must be clean continuous surfaces, with no black holes,
  labels, mirrors, sliced objects, or heavy stretching.

STYLE CONTRACT:
- Match the master image style exactly when a master reference is attached:
  same linework density, mixed-media texture, color treatment, lighting mood,
  material rendering, and animated-background finish.
- Do not drift into photorealism, live-action, clean 3D render, game asset,
  or glossy architectural visualization.
- No people, no characters, no story action.
- Do not invent new readable text. Preserve existing simple numeric marks or
  abstract signage already visible in the master/reverse references.
- Signs or posters may use abstract marks inspired by the master/reverse, but do
  not rely on new readable text.

faces, not VR headset screenshot, no labels, no UI, no watermark, no broken seam,
no duplicated doorway at seam, no warped horizon, no curved walls in VR viewer,
no stretched ceiling/floor poles, no mirrored left/right halves, no sliced object
at seam, no giant close foreground object, no photorealism.
